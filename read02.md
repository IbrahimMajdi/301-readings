# JQuery

> JQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 

### basic syntax
`$(selector).action()`

>A `$` sign is to define/access jQuery
>A `(selector)` is to “query (or find)” HTML elements in html page
> A jQuery `action()` is the action to be performed on the selected element(s)


> jQuery has methods that offer web developers
simpler ways to perform common tasks, such as:
• loop through elements
• Add I remove elements from the DOM tree
• Handle events
• Fade elements into I out of view
• Handle Ajax requests

> Rather than learn a new way to select elements,
jQuery uses a language that is already familiar to
front-end web developers: CSS selectors. They:
• Are much faster at selecting elements
• Can be a lot more accurate about which elements
to select
• Often require a lot less code than older DOM
methods
• Are already used by most front-end developers

> jQuery automatically handles the inconsistent ways
in which browsers select elements and handle
events.

> With jQuery, when a selector returns multiple elements, you
can update all of them using the one method. There is no need to
use a loop.
 
> With jQuery, you can hide and show HTML elements with the `hide()` and `show()` methods.

> With jQuery, you can check if the page is ready with `ready()` method.

> The `html1()` and `text() `methods both retrieve and update the content
of elements.

> The `.css()` method lets you retrieve and set the values of CSS properties.

> The `on()` method is used to handle all events.

> The `height()` and `width()` methods can be used to determine the
dimensions of both the browser window and the HTML document.
