> Functional programming suggests that the data and function(effect) should be separate. The function should have following properties

-Single task: A Function should be small and should perform single task

-Pure: Function should not have side effect and for same input it should provide same out

-Should have return statement.

-should be compose-able

-Immutable: Function should return a new copy of data and should not change the original state

-Should be predictable
